After examining all files and folders and reviewing the of loss data. I have evidence to believe that Dealer 'Billy Jones' and Player 'Mylie Schmidt' have been working together illegally to steal money from the casino at the Roulette tables.

I have reviewed all 3 dates of losses thoroughly and found that on each time anddate of significant losses both Dealer 'Billy Jones' and 'Mylie Schmidt' have been involved in the Roulette games. My evidence to prove these statements are attached to the assigned folders.

Yours sincerely, Ben Carroll.
